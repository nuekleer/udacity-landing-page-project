Landing Page Project

## HTML

Added a 4th section to the starter code.  Copy and paste to get done quickly. 

## CSS

Made a couple changes to make the active section more noticeable.  
H2 color and anchor background. 

## JavaScript

The major portion of the project was the JavaScript code.  

* Global variables for window height, HTML sections, and navigation were created.  

* Created a helper function that looped through takes an id as a parameter.  It then loops through the nav and sections removing active from all and adding active to the element that matches the parameter.  

* Nav building function creates a menu item for each HTML section tag on the page.  

* Listeners added for scroll, load, and resize

* In view function created to check the window height against each HTML section to see which was in the view port.
